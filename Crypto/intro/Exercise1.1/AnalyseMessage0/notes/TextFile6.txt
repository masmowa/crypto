1-Month SubscriberTwitch Primerusswinn: It's the ticket machine
3-Month Subscriber (3-Month Badge)Kleora: So what the fuck happened to "We;ll be starting /BEFORE/ the normal start time on Thursdays." Are were a fuckin' joke, or what the absolute hell is going on right now D<
11-Month Subscriber (6-Month Badge)gamingwizard43: As much as the delay sucks I'm glad they aren't starting it before the people who went to attend it manage to get inside. Push comes to shove I can always watch it later but they wouldn't get the experience of a live show back if the show wasn't delayed.

Moderator18-Month Subscriber (1-Year Badge)Twitch Primeladyamphy: 13:57 ladyamphy: HI I am one of the moderators for critical role. Please dont post fake rumors in the chat about the reason for the delay. It isn't very helpful when tensions are already high. 14:00 waldorf66: hey ladyamphy :)
ok I'm sorry I didn't think it might even look like a rumor since it is joking about alien abduction (in the spirit of traveler) but sure its already too messy out there i'll stop :)
good luck handling the chaos out there <3
14:01 ladyamphy: Thank you for understanding
